# Spacing-Out
Simple Space Shooting Game that was one of my first programs ever written. The user navigates a spaceship labeled "USA" using the arrow keys, and is tasked with destroying alien spaceships by firing bullets with the space bar.

This program was a fun way for me to learn about handling user keypresses, using the random class, and using the pygame library to draw bullets and spaceships on the screen. Making this program also taught me an important lesson about NOT altering a list or array which I am simultaneously iterating over :-).

The end result is a fun, responsive game that is mildly addictive. Although I wrote all the code myself, I cannot release the game as my own software because the idea for the game came from Atari's 1978 hit game "Space Invaders." See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders for further information. No copyright infringement occurred in the making of this game, it was purely for academic purposes.
