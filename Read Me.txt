This is a basic outer space shooting game where the user is flying a spaceship and has to shoot aliens.
It is a top-down scrolling game that progressively gets more difficult.
There are 3 types of aliens and 5 total weapons in the game.
This game was written in Python for academic purposes and depends on the PyGame library.

Making this game allowed me to practice:
Requesting and working with user keystrokes
Displaying text, images and polygons based on game logic
Working with arrays in a memory efficient manner
Nested while/for loops and nested if statements
